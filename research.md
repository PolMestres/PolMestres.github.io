### Control barrier functions for safety-critical control

Safety refers to the ability to ensure by design that the evolution of the dynamics stays within a desired set. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are a useful tool to deal with safety specifications that do not require addressing the difficult task of computing the systemâ€™s reachable set. In particular, we consider scenarios where safety must be achieved together with some stabilization goal. We design controllers that achieve both tasks and have appropriate smoothness guarantees. <img src="/assets/comp2-fi.jpg" width="500px" alt="PRE">

### Mathematical modelling of epidemics

The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed out the importance of having accurate, interpretable and robust models for the spread of an infectious disease in a population. In this work we build on well-established compartmental models for epidemic spread and include some of the features of the COVID-19 pandemic, like the existence of massive testing capabilities or the presence of wastewater detection plants. The result is a model which is partially tractable analytically and with interpretable parameters which can be used to design control policies to mitigate the spread of the disease.

### Event-triggered discretizations of optimization flows

Recent interest in first-order optimization algorithms has lead to the formulation of so-called high-resolution differential equations, continuous surrogates for some of the classical discrete-time optimization algorithms exhibiting acceleration. The continuous setting allows the use of some powerful and well-established tools, like Lyapunov functions. This framework can be used to gain some intuition into the still somewhat mysterious phenomenon of acceleration. In this work we study these high-resolution differential equations and the crucial problem of re-discretizing them while maintaining their rate of convergence. We also review a recent paper that proposes a discretization technique by using ideas borrowed from event-triggered control and suggest some improvements on those algorithms in terms of their rate of convergence.
