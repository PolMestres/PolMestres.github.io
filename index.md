I am a PhD student in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at UCSD under the supervision of Professor Jorge Cortés. I received a B.Sc in Mathematics and a B.Sc in Engineering Physics in 2020 from the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, in Barcelona. During September 2019 to March 2020 I was a visiting scholar at UCSD. My research interests lie at the intersection of optimization, control theory and networked systems.
